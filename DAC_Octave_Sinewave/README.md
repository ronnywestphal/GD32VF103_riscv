## Sine Wave To Audio
The tones are genereted using a 4x4 keyboard where each button corresponds to a frequency of a hardcoded sinewave. 
The desired frequencies are achieved by manipulating how fast the superloop handles the periodic tasks by using the keyboard to change the values in Counter Auto Reload. Values between 143 and 227 corresponds to frequencies between 4.4 and 7.5KHz.
